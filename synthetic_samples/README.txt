The Connecticut sample file is synthetic input for the NETSS generator.
The Oregon sample file is synthetic input for the HL7 generator.

Set the NETSS_DIR or HL7_DIR variable equal to "synthetic_samples" and
run the generators as if they were loading real data. The output should
be very similar to the originals.
